Genetic "learning" Smart Car using Java/Processing

Using the leasons learned from Daniel Shiffman's "Smart Rockets" (https://thecodingtrain.com/), I'm making Smart Cars.
They will attempt to drive in a circle without crashing.
Each "generation" will pass on the leasons learned by simulated natural selection.
